# Untamed_Ideas_Staging

Untamed Ideas is an application that aims to improve how people keep track of their ideas, plans, and concepts. The project is determined to storing all project information, whether it's big or small, in a quick and orderly fashion. It is also intended to display this information in whatever way best suits the user. The main benefactors of this application are developers and creators, who plan on developing new products for consumers. It also assists everyday people who need help orgainizing their tasks or chores. The application can be used on large and small projects, such as entire films or individual scenes.

The only current type of users are Creators. These creators can set up new ideas, each with their own descriptions and images. They can cycle between them, and change how each one is formatted. Users should be able to view and upload each idea in a quick manner. Given enough time, a secondary user will be created known as a viewer. When given permission, these users can view other user's ideas, allowing for collaboration.

Currently, the Database and Service API have been created, and most functions work. An Angular Single Page Application has been created, although it is for practice at this time. The next phase of the project is to connect the UI to the Service and begin improvements to how it looks.
